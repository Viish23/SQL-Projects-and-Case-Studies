# SQL-Projects-and-Case-Studies
A collection of SQL projects and case studies showcasing data analysis, queries, and database design. Ideal for learning and practicing real-world SQL scenarios.

This project explores customer, sales, and product data to uncover actionable business insights. As a database administrator, the goal is to analyze sales and profit trends across different states, assess marketing spend efficiency, and evaluate metrics such as COGS (Cost of Goods Sold) and budgeted profit.

üìä Problem Statement
Using a sample dataset (to maintain customer privacy), this project aims to answer key business questions, including:

Which products are generating the most sales and profit?

How does performance vary by state or region?

What is the relationship between marketing spend, COGS, and budget profit?

The analysis is performed entirely using SQL queries.

üóÇÔ∏è Datasets
The project uses the following datasets:

Fact Table: Contains transactional data such as sales, profit, COGS, and budgeted values.

Location Table: Includes geographic and state-level customer information.

Product Table: Details on product categories, names, and item identifiers.

‚úÖ Objectives
Write efficient and meaningful SQL queries to generate insights

Help identify high-performing products and regions

Lay the groundwork for further data-driven decision making
